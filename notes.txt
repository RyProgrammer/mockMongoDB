okay so what i have learned from this mini attempt at db stuff is that 
I need to get all the data from the fetch call. once i get this data,

I need to:
1. parse it and get the necessary elements that we are going to put on our recipe cards
2. once i get those, put them into a recipecard object. 
3. insert that recipe card object into our mongodb.

What I need today at some point is:
1. the list of data that will be displayed on each recipecard/view page
2. learn how to create a data object like that
3. divide up the files so that it is organized in a format that is both easy to access each file 
and easy to understand from a programmers perspective


To accomplish this stuff:
1. I need to relay this information to Brooks, frontend team.
2. plan with Brooks a lot. we will work very closely together on this
3. brooks needs to show me his code for spoonacular stuff so we can decide morethings
4. these things ^ we need to decide are how we are going to store data. this needs to be discussed exrensively

Once we get these things sorted out, the next step is divying up the work on who does what.
We will figure this out later today hopefully. 

recipecard: 
image, title

view page:
image, title, author, cooking time, servings, ingredients, instructions, tags,
***user specific: user created tags, favorited? (boolean)

tags is a thing we need to discuss. Are tags created for each recipe or do we let user make all their tags themselves
